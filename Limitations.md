# Known limitations and issues

1. The step-size for the detection process is always set to 1 and can't be adjusted.
2. The forecast horizon for DL models is always set to 1 and can't be adjusted.
3. The simulinkt detection doesn't implement the different data preparation methods and scoring functions, which makes it non-functional in some cases.
